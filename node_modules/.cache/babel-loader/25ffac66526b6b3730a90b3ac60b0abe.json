Shared access is\n * currently optional and not enabled unless all clients invoke\n * `enablePersistence()` with `{synchronizeTabs:true}`.\n *\n * In multi-tab mode, if multiple clients are active at the same time, the SDK\n * will designate one client as the “primary client”. An effort is made to pick\n * a visible, network-connected and active client, and this client is\n * responsible for letting other clients know about its presence.

If the primary client fails to\n * update this entry, another client can acquire the lease and take over as\n * primary.\n *\n * Some persistence operations in the SDK are designated as primary-client only\n * operations. This includes the acknowledgment of mutations and all updates of\n * remote documents. The effects of these operations are written to persistence\n * and then broadcast to other tabs via LocalStorage (see\n * `WebStorageSharedClientState`), which then refresh their state from\n * persistence.\n *\n * Similarly, the primary client listens to notifications sent by secondary\n * clients to discover persistence changes written by secondary clients, such as\n * the addition of new mutations and query targets.\n *\n * If multi-tab is not enabled and another tab already obtained the primary\n * lease, IndexedDbPersistence enters a failed state and all subsequent\n * operations will automatically fail.\n *\n * Additionally, there is an optimization so that when a tab is closed, the\n * primary lease is released immediately (this is especially important to make\n * sure that a refreshed tab is able to immediately re-acquire the primary\n * lease). Unfortunately, IndexedDB cannot be reliably used in window.unload\n * since it is an asynchronous API. So in addition to attempting to give up the\n * lease, the leaseholder writes its client ID to a \"zombiedClient\" entry in\n * LocalStorage which acts as an indicator that another tab should go ahead and\n * take the primary lease immediately regardless of the current lease timestamp.\n *\n * TODO(b/114226234): Remove `synchronizeTabs` section when multi-tab is no\n * longer optional.\n */\n\n/**\n * Helper to get a typed SimpleDbStore for the primary client object store.\n */\n\n\nfunction Ri(t) {\n  return Rr(t, rr.store);\n}\n/**\n * Helper to get a typed SimpleDbStore for the client metadata object store.\n */\n\n\nfunction Oi(t) {\n  return Rr(t, yr.store);\n}\n/**\n * Generates a string used as a prefix when storing data in IndexedDB and\n * LocalStorage.\n */\n\n\nfunction Pi(t, e) {\n  // Use two different prefix formats:\n  //   * firestore / persistenceKey / projectID . databaseID / ...\n  //   * firestore / persistenceKey / projectID / ...\n  // projectIDs are DNS-compatible names and cannot contain dots\n  // so there's no danger of collisions.\n  var n = t.projectId;\n  return t.isDefaultDatabase || (n += \".\" + t.database), \"firestore/\" + e + \"/\" + n + \"/\"\n  /**\n  * @license\n  * Copyright 2020 Google LLC\n  *\n  * Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n  * you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n  * You may obtain a copy of the License at\n  *\n  *   http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n  *\n  * Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n  * distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n  * WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n  * See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n  * limitations under the License.\n  */\n  ;\n}\n\nvar Mi = function (t, e) {\n  this.progress = t, this.En = e;\n},\n    Fi =\n/** @class */\nfunction () {\n  function t(t, e, n) {\n    this.ze = t, this.Tn = e, this.Gt = n\n    /**\n    * Get the local view of the document identified by `key`.\n    *\n    * @returns Local view of the document or null if we don't have any cached\n    * state for it.\n    */\n    ;\n  }\n\n  return t.prototype.In = function (t, e) {\n    var n = this;\n    return this.Tn.getAllMutationBatchesAffectingDocumentKey(t, e).next(function (r) {\n      return n.An(t, e, r);\n    });\n  },\n  /** Internal version of `getDocument` that allows reusing batches. */\n  t.prototype.An = function (t, e, n) {\n    return this.ze.getEntry(t, e).next(function (t) {\n      for (var r = 0, i = n; r < i.length; r++) {\n        t = i[r].applyToLocalView(e, t);\n      }\n\n      return t;\n    });\n  }, // Returns the view of the given `docs` as they would appear after applying\n  // all mutations in the given `batches`.\n  t.prototype.Rn = function (t, e, n) {\n    var r = tn();\n    return e.forEach(function (t, e) {\n      for (var i = 0, o = n; i < o.length; i++) {\n        e = o[i].applyToLocalView(t, e);\n      }\n\n      r = r.insert(t, e);\n    }), r;\n  },\n  /**\n   * Gets the local view of the documents identified by `keys`.\n   *\n   * If we don't have cached state for a document in `keys`, a NoDocument will\n   * be stored for that key in the resulting set.\n   */\n  t.prototype.bn = function (t, e) {\n    var n = this;\n    return this.ze.getEntries(t, e).next(function (e) {\n      return n.vn(t, e);\n    });\n  },\n  /**\n   * Similar to `getDocuments`, but creates the local view from the given\n   * `baseDocs` without retrieving documents from the local store.\n   */\n  t.prototype.vn = function (t, e) {\n    var n = this;\n    return this.Tn.getAllMutationBatchesAffectingDocumentKeys(t, e).next(function (r) {\n      var i = n.Rn(t, e, r),\n          o = Ze();\n      return i.forEach(function (t, e) {\n        // TODO(http://b/32275378): Don't conflate missing / deleted.\n        e || (e = new wt(t, ie.min())), o = o.insert(t, e);\n      }), o;\n    });\n  },\n  /**\n   * Performs a query against the local view of all documents.\n   *\n   * @param transaction - The persistence transaction.\n   * @param query - The query to match documents against.\n   * @param sinceReadTime - If not set to SnapshotVersion.min(), return only\n   *     documents that have been read since this snapshot version (exclusive).\n   */\n  t.prototype.getDocumentsMatchingQuery = function (t, e, n) {\n    /**\n    * Returns whether the query matches a single document by path (rather than a\n    * collection).\n    */\n    return function (t) {\n      return H.isDocumentKey(t.path) && null === t.collectionGroup && 0 === t.filters.length;\n    }(e) ?

Otherwise, if the transaction failed, a\n * rejected promise with the corresponding failure error is returned.\n */\n\n/**\n * @license\n * Copyright 2017 Google LLC\n *\n * Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n * you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n * You may obtain a copy of the License at\n *\n *   http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n *\n * Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n * distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n * WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n * See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n * limitations under the License.\n */\n\n/** Helper function to assert Uint8Array is available at runtime. */\n\n\nfunction Ic() {\n  if (\"undefined\" == typeof Uint8Array) throw new G(j.UNIMPLEMENTED, \"Uint8Arrays are not available in this environment.\");\n}\n/** Helper function to assert Base64 functions are available at runtime. */\n\n\nfunction Ec() {\n  if (\"undefined\" == typeof atob) throw new G(j.UNIMPLEMENTED, \"Blobs are unavailable in Firestore in this environment.\");\n}\n/** Immutable class holding a blob (binary data) */\n\n\nvar Tc =\n/** @class */\nfunction (t) {\n  function e() {\n    return null !== t && t.apply(this, arguments) || this;\n  }\n\n  return m(e, t), e.fromBase64String = function (t) {\n    return Ec(), new e(pa.fromBase64String(t));\n  }, e.fromUint8Array = function (t) {\n    return Ic(), new e(pa.fromUint8Array(t));\n  }, e.prototype.toBase64 = function () {\n    return Ec(), this._delegate.toBase64();\n  }, e.prototype.toUint8Array = function () {\n    return Ic(), this._delegate.toUint8Array();\n  }, e.prototype.isEqual = function (t) {\n    return this._delegate.isEqual(t._delegate);\n  }, e.prototype.toString = function () {\n    return \"Blob(base64: \" + this.toBase64() + \")\";\n  }, e;\n}(Ju),\n    _c =\n/** @class */\nfunction () {\n  function t() {}\n\n  return t.prototype.enableIndexedDbPersistence = function (t, e) {\n    return function (t, e) {\n      la(t = Qu(t, aa));\n\n      var n = ca(t),\n          r = t._freezeSettings(),\n          i = new pu();\n\n      return fa(n, i, new lu(i, r.cacheSizeBytes, null == e ? void 0 : e.forceOwnership));\n    }(t._delegate, {\n      forceOwnership: e\n    });\n  }, t.prototype.enableMultiTabIndexedDbPersistence = function (t) {\n    return function (t) {\n      la(t = Qu(t, aa));\n\n      var e = ca(t),\n          n = t._freezeSettings(),\n          r = new pu();\n\n      return fa(e, r, new du(r, n.cacheSizeBytes));\n    }(t._delegate);\n  }, t.prototype.clearIndexedDbPersistence = function (t) {\n    return function (t) {\n      var e = this;\n      if (t._initialized && !t._terminated) throw new G(j.FAILED_PRECONDITION, \"Persistence can only be cleared before a Firestore instance is initialized or after it is terminated.\");\n      var n = new Ir();\n      return t._queue.enqueueAndForgetEvenWhileRestricted(function () {\n        return w(e, void 0, void 0, function () {\n          var e;\n          return b(this, function (r) {\n            switch (r.label) {\n              case 0:\n                return r.trys.push([0, 2,, 3]), [4\n                /*yield*/\n                , function (t) {\n                  return w(this, void 0, void 0, function () {\n                    var e;\n                    return b(this, function (n) {\n                      switch (n.label) {\n                        case 0:\n                          return _r.At() ?

Data is stored persistently\n * across sessions.\n *\n * On Web only, the Firestore SDKs support shared access to its persistence\n * layer. This allows multiple browser tabs to read and write to IndexedDb and\n * to synchronize state even without network connectivity. Shared access is\n * currently optional and not enabled unless all clients invoke\n * `enablePersistence()` with `{synchronizeTabs:true}`.\n *\n * In multi-tab mode, if multiple clients are active at the same time, the SDK\n * will designate one client as the “primary client”. An effort is made to pick\n * a visible, network-connected and active client, and this client is\n * responsible for letting other clients know about its presence. The primary\n * client writes a unique client-generated identifier (the client ID) to\n * IndexedDb’s “owner” store every 4 seconds. If the primary client fails to\n * update this entry, another client can acquire the lease and take over as\n * primary.\n *\n * Some persistence operations in the SDK are designated as primary-client only\n * operations. This includes the acknowledgment of mutations and all updates of\n * remote documents. The effects of these operations are written to persistence\n * and then broadcast to other tabs via LocalStorage (see\n * `WebStorageSharedClientState`), which then refresh their state from\n * persistence.\n *\n * Similarly, the primary client listens to notifications sent by secondary\n * clients to discover persistence changes written by secondary clients, such as\n * the addition of new mutations and query targets.\n *\n * If multi-tab is not enabled and another tab already obtained the primary\n * lease, IndexedDbPersistence enters a failed state and all subsequent\n * operations will automatically fail.\n *\n * Additionally, there is an optimization so that when a tab is closed, the\n * primary lease is released immediately (this is especially important to make\n * sure that a refreshed tab is able to immediately re-acquire the primary\n * lease). Unfortunately, IndexedDB cannot be reliably used in window.unload\n * since it is an asynchronous API. So in addition to attempting to give up the\n * lease, the leaseholder writes its client ID to a \"zombiedClient\" entry in\n * LocalStorage which acts as an indicator that another tab should go ahead and\n * take the primary lease immediately regardless of the current lease timestamp.\n *\n * TODO(b/114226234): Remove `synchronizeTabs` section when multi-tab is no\n * longer optional.\n */\nclass Fi {\n    constructor(\n    /**\n     * Whether to synchronize the in-memory state of multiple tabs and share\n     * access to local persistence.\n     */\n    t, e, n, s, i, r, o, c, a, \n    /**\n     * If set to true, forcefully obtains database access.
